NAME
    Term::GnuScreen - Control GNU screen via perl

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Term::GnuScreen provides a simple interface to control a GNU screen
    session via its command line interface.

        use Term::GnuScreen;

        my $screen = Term::GnuScreen->new();
        $screen->windowlist;
        $screen->hardcopy('/tmp/my_hardcopy');

METHODS
    Term::GnuScreen implements all commands as stated in the texinfo
    document shipped with GNU screen. To call a commands, it's send via GNU
    screens -X paramter to the first running screen session and its current
    window. You can change session and window with the according object
    methods and construction paramters. Unless listed here, all remaining
    arguments are handled over to screen.

  send_command
    This command is the working horse of Term::GnuScreen. It simply build
    the command line to call and add all the supplied arguments to screens
    -X.

  hardcopy
    Write a hardcopy of the current window to a temporary file and returns
    the filename unless the filename is supplied as first argument.

ERROR HANDLING
    Simple dies in case screen -X did not return with a return value of
    zero. Either $!, STDERR or STDOUT (which seems to be more helpful most
    times) are provided as error message for further investigation.
